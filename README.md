# visNanopub
## Overview
This is an R script that generates a JavaScript visualization for Nanopublications. [Nanopublications](https://nanopub.net/) are small knowledge graph snippets. I believe that knowledge graphs hold a great deal of potential to bridge knowledge gaps, but tend to be a little tough to work with without technical expertise.

This script is a starting point. It has lots of to-dos:
- It's a bit messy still and the URI is not clickable.
- Convert into a Shiny app that allows people to input their Nanopublication URI.
- Enable functionality for multiple Nanopublications, which would show linkages between them.
- Just clean it up - I'm not a great coder, so there's lots of messy stuff in here.

Please reach out if you can/want to help!
